# Early fire dection on forestal areas using smart agents
### Niñaj Awin (The eye of the fire in Aimará language)
<br>
This is an academic project that took place on (2015) in UMSS, Cochabamba Bolivia. 
Called "La Fabrica", was meant to teach students AI, automatic control, research, team collaboration for R&D and interaction with other departments like Math, physics, electronics, materials and engineering, as well with society actors like firefighter department, city government etc.

The project addressed a very real problem in Parque Tunari, where every year the risk of fire is huge and every fire is devastating for the environment and for the city itself. 
The early fire detection on forestal areas using autonomous agents installed in drones, as well as augmented reality and human-managed drones was proposed as a practical solution as well as an academic opportunity to learn.

- The autonomous agents were trained to search and react when detecting smoke or fire. 
- Augmented reality was used as assistance to the firefighter department to identify the type of fire, edges and people.

Since all the goals where achieved, the project was never reach prodcution, mostly because of financial problems, but, many product were dirved from, at least 5 thesis comes from it and parts of the research, software artefacts and models are used on other projects.
